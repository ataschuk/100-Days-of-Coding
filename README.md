# 100-Days-of-Coding Log Book:

**Day 0:**

- Began to work on Snake game
- Created rough draft of all class, interfaces, ect needed
- Started to learn about tkinter 

- Gave up on learning about tkinter for now and moved on to creating the game w/ turtles for now
- Tried to create a checkered pattern w/ turtle for game board. Failed.

**Day 1:**

- Began to understand basic syntax around python (for loops and if statements) and the basics of the turtle module:

    - `turtle.shape, color, speed, goto, setheading, penup/down, stamp,'

**Day 2:**

- Successfully created a checkered board with the turtle module

- Deleted game.py file because I decided to build off of the turtlePractice board.

- To begin learning tkinter, I'll use a website I found  that has tkinter tutorials
