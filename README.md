# 100-Days-of-Coding Log Book:

**Day 0: 2/1/23**

- Began to work on Snake game
- Created rough draft of all class, interfaces, ect needed
- Started to learn about tkinter 

- Gave up on learning about tkinter for now and moved on to creating the game w/ turtles for now
- Tried to create a checkered pattern w/ turtle for game board. Failed.

**Day 1:2/2/23**

- Began to understand basic syntax around python (for loops and if statements) and the basics of the turtle module:

    - `turtle.shape, color, speed, goto, setheading, penup/down, stamp,'

**Day 2: 2/3/23**

- Successfully created a checkered board with the turtle module

- Deleted game.py file because I decided to build off of the turtlePractice board.

- Began to learn tkinter

**Day 3: 2/4/23**

- Read about different tkkinter commands and continued to get a basic understanding of the tkinter syntax

- Began to use the [Official Tk Commands Reference Menu](https://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl8.6/TkCmd/contents.html) to learn about the different commands and widgets tkinter offers

- I also found a solid website with some explinations of [tkinter Widgets](https://www.studytonight.com/tkinter)

- [Official Python Documentation on tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html)
   
- Got a decent understanding of the label widget down.

**Day 4: 2/5/23**

- Learned about buttons and frames   

**Day 5: 2/6/23**

- Figured out how to have a button open a new screen when pressed.

- Added a "Back" button that closes the "rules" Toplevel when pressed.

- Added a "Quit Game" button that closes the program when pressed.

- `.grid()` will not work Toplevel (at least I couldn't figure out how to make it work so I'm assuming that only works with windows)

- I have a decent understanding of basic widgets such as `Button`, `Label`, `Frame`, `Title` and what a window is.
